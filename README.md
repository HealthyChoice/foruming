# OW TO INSTALL

You are probably too dumb or techincally illiterate to know how to properly install python packages, so will do this just like we do in 'special school*

before you install you will need the following:

the python interpreter: if you didnt realize you'd need this by now then leave this page now
setuptools: special tool for installing packages. if you installed pip along with the pytho interpreter like you should've, 'pip install setuptools' should get them for you. if you have problems with this, google it, because setuptools and pip are separate from my package and will have widespread support among the python community

Follow these steps to install once you have the other tools installed

1. downlaod the package: The simplest way to do this is click 'Download as ZIP'
2. extract it: the package will be in a compressed format by default, so it must be extracted. simply use 7zip or winrar to extract the zip file to an accessible spot on your computer, like your desktop
3. run the setup file: Open a terminal/command prompt in the directory you extracted and run this command: "python3 setup.py install". You shold probably run CMD if you're on windows, or put 'sudo' in front of the aforementioned command if you use linux. If you use mac install a proper operating system
4. realize you've accomplished absolutely nothing in your life and likely never will: This step may take longer to complete than the others

There. that's literally it. If you cannot follow these simple steps you are very certianly mentally challenged

To ensure that you haven't fucked up, open a python shell and type 'import foruming'. If the shell doesnt yell at you, you've done everything right. Congradulations on your demonstration of basic cognitive function.

reminder: this module is for python3. disgusting python2 peasants can get their filth-ridden hands off of my git page. their kind is not welcome here
